# Algorithms in C and Prolog

This is a personal project to explore and implement classic and advanced algorithms using **C** and **Prolog**, with a focus on **mathematical foundations** and **problem-solving skills**.

## 🔍 Purpose

- Practice and showcase algorithms in both low-level (**C**) and declarative (**Prolog**) languages.
- Strengthen understanding of mathematical principles behind algorithms.
- Build a solid foundation for future graduate studies in computer science.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 📘 In C

#### 🔹 Basics
- Pointers
- Loops
- Arrays (1D & Multidimensional)
- Recursion
- Dynamic Memory Allocation

#### 🔹 Data Structures
- Dynamic Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees

### 📗 In Prolog

- Writing and using **predicates**
- Understanding **logical inference**
- Building simple rules and queries

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This is a private, educational project. Over time, I plan to:
- Add more algorithm implementations
- Apply more math-based logic and reasoning
- Organize the code into categories with clear documentation
