/* This program plays draw poker. Users can play as often as they 
want, betting between 1 and 5. They are dealt 5 cards and then get 
to choose which cards to keep, and which cards to replace. The new 
hand is then reviewed and the user's payout is set based on the 
value of the hand. The user's new bankroll is displayed as they are 
given
    the option to continue. */
